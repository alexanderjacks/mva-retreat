## Purpose of the Emerging Leaders Retreat

1. To the develop a community of emerging minority veteran leaders who will carry the mission of MVA forward.
2. To bring the MVA leadership team to learn and grow while sharing space.
3. To invest deeply in the individual and leadership development of each member of the MVA leadership team.
4. To challenge our leaders to grow and stretch their understanding of the communities we serve. 
5. To help MVA leaders feel more connected to the mission of the organization and their own role within it.
6. To partner leaders with mentors after the retreat who will commit to the development our leaders on an ongoing basis. 



## How do we solve the greatest issues facing the minority veteran community?

This is a question that many are grappling with as Veterans of Color, LGBTQ, Womxn, and (Non) Religious Minority veterans continue to be disproportionately impacted by nearly every issue facing the veteran community today.

We believe that in order to confront the greatest issues affecting our communities, we must empower emerging leaders to create community driven solutions. In doing this, we create belonging and community investment that we can turn toward addressing the equity gaps that exist for minority and underrepresented veterans.

This year, MVA will host our inaugural Emerging Leaders Retreat from Aug. 21-23, 2019 in Seattle, WA. Our team has set the ambitious goal of educating 25 leaders from around the country. These leaders represent a community eager for leadership and opportunity, that want to continue to serve in a new capacity. This is the next generation of leaders, ready to develop their proficiencies to face complex challenges head on.

These are minority vet leaders.

## Letter to Leaders

Dear MVA Leadership Team,

Welcome to Seattle! We are so excited to have you at this inaugural Minority Veterans of America Emerging Leader Retreat. Never did I think, just one year ago, that this would be where we are as an organization today. At this time last year, I still felt a sense of despair after feeling like there was no place in the veteran community that would let me be a part, just the way that I am. No more, no less. 

As we all know, the answer was that there was no place. In response, we came together and did what we do best. We rolled up our sleeves and go to work. We built something. 

That’s our story. You all are the manifestation of our community’s ability to unite and rise up. We are all resilient, determined, and damn good leaders. We have proven we are capable of leading this community with a message of radical inclusion, in the hopes of building a brighter future for us all. 

This retreat will be fun, challenging, and, with any luck, we will all leave here stronger and recharged, ready to tackle the next year ahead of us. If at any point, you have questions, comments, or concerns, please don’t hesitate to tell me or one of your leaders so we can address it immediately. 

Please approach this weekend with a growth mindset and bring everything you have to each session. What we each walk away with from this weekend will be a direct result of what each of us puts into it. I am here to learn from each of you and I’m so excited to be a part. 

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being in here this weekend and for all of the work you each have put in to make MVA what it is today. We would not be here without each and every one of you.



Cheers,

_Lindsay Church_<br/>
_President_<br/>
