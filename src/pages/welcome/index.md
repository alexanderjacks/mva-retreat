## Dear Emerging Leaders,

Welcome to Seattle! We are so excited to have you at this inaugural Minority Veterans of America Emerging Leader Retreat. Never did I think, just two years ago when we were just starting out, that this would be where we are as an organization and community today. At this time two years ago, I felt a sense of despair after feeling like there was no place in the veteran community that would let me be a part, just the way that I am. No more, no less. 

As we all know, the answer was that there was no place. In response, we came together and did what we do best. We rolled up our sleeves and go to work. We built something. 

That’s our story. This retreat and every one of you are the manifestation of our community’s ability to unite and rise up. We are resilient, determined, and damn good leaders. We have proven we are capable of leading this community with a message of radical inclusion, in the hopes of building a brighter future for us all. 

This retreat will be fun, challenging, and, with any luck, we will all leave here stronger and recharged, ready to tackle the challenges ahead of us. If at any point, you have questions, comments, or concerns, please don’t hesitate to tell me or one of your leaders so we can address it immediately. 

Please approach this weekend with a growth mindset and bring everything you have to each session. What we each walk away with from this weekend will be a direct result of what each of us puts into it. I am here to learn from each of you and I’m so excited to be a part. 

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being a part of this retreat and for all of the work leadership that each of you has put forward in this community. Each of you challenges what it means to be a veteran. MVA would not be here without each and every one of you.



*Cheers to a beautiful three days,*
