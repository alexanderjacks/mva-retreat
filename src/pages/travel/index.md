## Getting Around Seattle
Seattle has some of the best public transportation in the United States. You can purchase daily passes for unlimited use at multiple [locations](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/fares-orca/where-to-buy.aspx) throughout Seattle and at the SEATAC airport.  Visit [King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro.aspx) to learn more about how to use and plan a trip or download the app One Bus Away for live route information. 


### Ride Share

Uber and Lyft are easily accessible throughout the city but can become expensive during commuting hours in the morning and evening. During rush hours, public transportation is the best option as there are dedicated bus lanes and the light rail is underground in the city.
